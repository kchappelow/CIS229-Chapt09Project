#Chapter 9 Project

Problem Description:
(The Account class) Design a class named Account that contains: 

*	A private int data field named id for the account (default 0).
*	A private double data field named balance for the account (default 0).
*	A private double data field named annualInterestRate that stores the current interest rate (default 0). **Assume all accounts have the same interest rate.**
*	A private Date data field named dateCreated that stores the date when the account was created.
*	A no-arg constructor that creates a default account.
*	A constructor that creates an account with the specified id and initial balance.
*	The accessor and mutator methods for id, balance, and annualInterestRate. 
*	The accessor method for dateCreated. 
*	A method named getMonthlyInterestRate() that returns the monthly interest rate.
*	A method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the account.
*	A method named deposit that deposits a specified amount to the account.

Use the test program that 

* creates an Account object with an account ID of 1122, a balance of $20,000, and an annual interest rate of 4.5%. 
* Use the withdraw method to withdraw $2,500, 
* use the deposit method to deposit $3,000, and 
* prints the balance, 
* prints the monthly interest, and 
* prints the date when this account was created.

##Tasks
 * Requirements: Create a document that describes the problem including input and output in your own words.

* Design: Draw an UML class diagram for the Account class.

* Code: Implement the class and 
* Submit the files using git
